# Java Web Server
Its a web server (poorly) written in Java...

DO NOT...
- ...use in production.
- ...expect security.
- ...expect functionality.
- ...expect this to work in general
- ...expect this to be fast.
- ...expect this to be memory efficient.
- ...any further development.

I just wanted to see if I could write a web server that responded to GET request but could also respond with other status codes if needed. Its a massive PITA to constantly concatenate byte arrays, which is needed to send file data.

If you do try and use this...WTF is wrong with you! DON'T DO THAT! 

It does work.
